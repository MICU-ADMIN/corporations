Here is the Mermaid Markdown overview for the Go file you provided:
```mermaid
graph LR
  A[accentColor] --> B[baseFontSize]
  B --> C[Go]
  C --> D[JSON]
  D --> E[file]
```
Explanation:

* `A` represents the `accentColor` field in the JSON object, which is empty (`""`).
* `B` represents the `baseFontSize` field in the JSON object, which has a value of `15`.
* `C` represents the `Go` keyword, which is the language used to define the JSON object.
* `D` represents the `JSON` keyword, which is the format of the JSON object.
* `E` represents the `file` keyword, which is the name of the file that contains the JSON object.
Note: The `graph LR` direction is used to indicate that the relationships between the nodes are left-to-right.
